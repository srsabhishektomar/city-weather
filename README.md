# city-weather

This is a Drupal 8 module.  Module query an external API called OpenWeather to retrieve current weather information for a given city.  An example title of such a node would be London, UK. We are interested in retrieving the current temperature and highs & lows for the given day, in metric units, stored in the node's body.
